My Dearest,

From the moment I met you, my life changed in ways I never imagined. You are the light in my darkest days and the laughter in my happiest moments.

Every day with you is a gift, and I find myself falling in love with you more and more. Your kindness, your smile, your heart - everything about you is perfect to me.

I wanted to create this to show you just how much you mean to me. But words are often not enough...

Yours, always.
